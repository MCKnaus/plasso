## Resubmission / Reactivation

This is a resubmission of the package 'plasso', which was archived on 2025-06-03
because the maintainer email became undeliverable. The new maintainer is
Michael C. Knaus (Authors@R role = "cre") with a stable institutional address.

Only the maintainer field and minor documentation details were updated.
No functional changes were made.

This resubmission addresses the DESCRIPTION remarks:
- Replaced "library" with "package".
- Added proper single quotes around software names such as 'glmnet'.
- Replaced backticks by plain function names with parentheses, e.g., plasso().
- Added the reference Knaus (2021) <doi:10.1111/rssa.12623>.

All checks pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
