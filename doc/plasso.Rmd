This notebook provides a detailed overview over the `plasso` package and its two main functions `plasso` and `cv.plasso`. This package is strongly oriented around the `glmnet` package and rests on its standard function `glmnet` in its very basis.


# Getting started

Make sure that you install the package from its [Github page](https://github.com/stefan-1997/plasso). For the installation you will need the `devtools` package. The dependencies of `plasso` are: `glmnet`, `Matrix`, `methods`, `parallel`, `doParallel`, `foreach` and `iterators`.

```{r}

library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("stefan-1997/plasso")

```

Then, `plasso` can be loaded via the standard `library` function.

```{r}

library(plasso)

```



# plasso

tbd

# cv.plasso

tbd

```{r}

```
