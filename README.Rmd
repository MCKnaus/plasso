# plasso <img src='docs/figures/plasso.png' align="right" height="139" />

Built on top of the `glmnet` library by @glmnet, the `plasso` package follows @knaus and comes up with two functions that estimate least squares Lasso and Post-Lasso models.
The `plasso()` function adds coefficient paths for a Post-Lasso model to the standard `glmnet()` output.
On top of that `cv.plasso()` cross-validates the coefficient paths for both the Lasso and Post-Lasso model and provides optimal hyperparameter values for the penalty term lambda.
